## queue vs list
most cases, queue is better than list.  
if need to compare the list in the same layer. just mark the count...
## visited
in graph, use set or hash to mark

# level-related tree problem

1.Minimum Height Trees
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-height-trees/  
bfs to cal the depth of the tree.  
to find the tree with min depth, instead of calculating depth of every node, there is an easy way to optimize.

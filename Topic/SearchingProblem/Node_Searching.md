# three-techniques
1. DFS
2. BFS
3. Backtracking

## easy BFS:
pop parent, add child in queue

## in graph: visited
in graph, use set or hash to mark


## EXAMPLES
1. Symmetric Tree:

# decision tree searching
1. word larder  
https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/  
trick here: hash..

# graphc expending
1.Minimum Height Trees
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-height-trees/  
bfs to cal the depth of the tree.  
to find the tree with min depth, instead of calculating depth of every node, there is an easy way to optimize.
